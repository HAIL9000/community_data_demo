As an\r\nexample, Puppet Enterprise catalogs fail to compile if the\r\n`fact_stomp_server`, and `fact_stomp_port` facts are not defined.\r\n\r\n`facter_dot_d` was removed from stdlib version 4 because Facter version\r\n1.7 now supports external facts defined in\r\n`/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt`.\r\nPuppet Enterprise does not yet include Facter 1.7, however.  The most\r\nrecent PE release, 2.8.1, includes Facter 1.6.17.  With this version of\r\nFacter, users who replace the version of stdlib that ships with PE with\r\nthe most recent version from the Forge will lose the ability to resolve\r\nfacts from\r\n`/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt`.\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the problem by detecting if Facter version < 1.7 is\r\nloaded.  If so, then the facter_dot_d.rb facts will be defined using the\r\nstdlib custom fact.  If Facter >= 1.7 is being used then stdlib will not\r\ndefine external facts.",

    "body": "I'll explain the change, why I'd like it, and how I implemented it in the following.\r\nEDIT: sorry, it should only concern commit 3077d26, not all three.\r\n\r\nProposed change:\r\nif merge gets passed an undefined variable, it doesn't fail with an exception, but instead silently ignores the value\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nIn my configuration file, one parameter can be repeatedly set with different values. Both key and value are variable, so I use a hash. Based on the input, different values are used, so I create multiple hashes, combine them with merge and then pass them to the template as one (the template is part of a more generic puppet module and should not know about the different internal hashes I created).\r\n\r\nBecause some value are used, merge fails and I would have to check first for all combinations and then call merge in the right way.\r\nI have three hashes to combine so I already have to check for nine combinations, for somebody with more it's even less feasible.\r\n\r\nI'll sketch the code here:\r\n\r\n    if one {\r\n        var1 = { abc => 123, bcd => 234 }\r\n    }\r\n    if two {\r\n        var2 = { def => 456 }\r\n    }\r\n    if three { ... }\r\n\r\n    var = merge(var1, var2, var3) # might fail if one is undef\r\n\r\nCode change:\r\nAdd a check for .empty? for every argument. Good, because it filters everything that is not empty: string, lists, ... . Bad, because you could get away with passing a wrong type in some cases, get an exception in others. Unfortunately, puppets undef doesn't seem to map to anything useful in ruby. We can use arg == \"\", but that's only slightly better.\r\nAny other ideas are most welcome!",

Example:\n\n    validate_augeas(\"root ALL=(ALL) ALL\\n\", \"Sudoers.lns\")\n\nThe function optionally takes an array of paths which should not be found in the content.\n\nFor example, if you want to make sure your passwd content never contains  a user `foo`, you could write:\n\n    validate_augeas($passwdcontent, 'Passwd.lns', ['$file/foo'])\n\nOr if you wanted to ensure that no users used the '/bin/barsh' shell, you could use:\n\n    validate_augeas($passwdcontent, 'Passwd.lns', ['$file/*[shell=\"/bin/barsh\"]']\n\nLike all validate_* functions, it fails compilation if the check fails. It also takes an optional 4rd argument to specify a nicer message.\n",

Failing with a parse error is\r\nsurprising, given that C, Ruby, Python and Perl tend to define 'true' as 'not\r\nfalse'.\r\n    \r\nA more particular use-case is given in the ticket:\r\n    \r\nhttp://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/14908\r\n\r\nPrevious pull request was puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#74\r\n",

These functions look\r\nthrough all interfaces for `ipaddress_<interface>` and `network_<interface>`\r\n(respectively) having the requested `<value>`.\r\n\r\nThese functions are implemented on top of a lower-level predicate\r\nfunction, `has_interface_with(kind, value)`, which iterates through the\r\ninterfaces in the `interfaces` fact and checks the facts `<kind>_<interface>`\r\nlooking for `<value>`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the existence of a particular named interface can be checked for\r\nby calling with only a single argument: `has_interface_with(interface)`.\r\n\r\nA Boolean is returned in all cases.",

    "body": "Its often the case that modules need to install a handful of packages. In\nsome cases its worth breaking these dependencies out into their own modules\n(e.g., Java). In others it makes more sense to keep them in the module. This\ncan be problematic when multiple modules depend on common packages (git,\npython ruby, etc). ensure_resource was a good first step towards solving this\nproblem. ensure_resource does not handle arrays and for 3 or more packages\nstamping out ensure_resource declarations is tedious.\n\nensure_packages is a convenience function that takes an array of packages and\nwraps calls to ensure_resource. Currently users cannot specify package\nversions. But the function could be extended to use a hash if that\nfunctionality would be useful.",

This is a problem because\nPuppet 2.7.x currently throws an exception if a rvalue function is invoked\nas if it were a statement function.  This exception from Puppet is causing\ntests to fail.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by changing the tests to assign the return\nvalue of the functions to a variable.  This fixes the problem by invoking\nthe functions properly.\n\nPaired-with: Andrew Parker <andy@puppetlabs.com>",

    "body": "This patch is the same approach as the one that want into 2.3.x.  It covers\nthe functions in master that do not exist in 2.3.x.\n\nWithout this patch all of the spec tests for parser functions in stdlib would\ninstantiate their own scope instances.  This is a problem because the\nstandard library is tightly coupled with the internal behavior of Puppet. \nTight coupling like this creates failures when we change the internal\nbehavior of Puppet.  This is exactly what happened recently when we changed\nthe method signature for the initializer of Puppet::Parser::Scope instances.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by creating scope instances using the puppet\nlabs spec helper.  The specific method that provides scope instances in\nPuppet-version-independent way is something like this:\n\n    let(:scope) { PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetInternals.scope }\n\nThis patch simply implements this across the board.\n\nPaired-with: Andrew Parker <andy@puppetlabs.com>",

    "body": "The module PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetSeams has been renamed in the \npuppetlabs_spec_helper gem to PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetInternals.\n\nThe method to obtain a scope object has also changed slightly.  Without this\npatch the spec tests will fail because the stdlib module is not aligned with\nthe spec helper gem.  This patch fixes the problem by matching up messages\nwith their receivers in the spec helper library.\n\nPaired-with: Andrew Parker <andy@puppetlabs.com>\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nMerging this into 2.2.x should be coordinated with the spec helper pull\nrequest that renames these module methods:\n\nhttps://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper/pull/18",

    "body": "b20d0da (Jeff McCune, 27 minutes ago)\n   (Maint) Fix up the get_module_path parser function\n\n   This patch switches the spec tests for the get_module_path function to use\n   mock objects.  The underlying Puppet::Module.find method has reasonable\n   test coverage inside of Puppet core so we might as well break the tight\n   dependency while we're fixing up the specs to use the new parser scope.\n\n   The behavior of the parser function itself should still have complete\n   coverage even though the tests have switched to mock the implementation\n   inside of Puppet.\n\n8fb0a46 (Jeff McCune, 2 hours ago)\n   (Maint) use PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetSeams.parser_scope (2.3.x)\n\n   This patch is the same approach as the one that want into 2.2.x.  It\n   covers the functions in 2.3.x that do not exist in 2.2.x.\n\n   Without this patch all of the spec tests for parser functions in stdlib\n   would instantiate their own scope instances.  This is a problem because\n   the standard library is tightly coupled with the internal behavior of\n   Puppet.  Tight coupling like this creates failures when we change the\n   internal behavior of Puppet.  This is exactly what happened recently when\n   we changed the method signature for the initializer of\n   Puppet::Parser::Scope instances.\n\n   This patch fixes the problem by creating scope instances using the puppet\n   labs spec helper.  The specific method that provides scope instances in\n   Puppet-version-independent way is something like this:\n\n    let(:scope) { PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetSeams.parser_scope }\n\n   This patch simply implements this across the board.",

    "body": "Without this patch all of the spec tests for parser functions in stdlib\nwould instantiate their own scope instances.  This is a problem because\nthe standard library is tightly coupled with the internal behavior of\nPuppet.  Tight coupling like this creates failures when we change the\ninternal behavior of Puppet.  This is exactly what happened recently when\nwe changed the method signature for the initializer of\nPuppet::Parser::Scope instances.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by creating scope instances using the puppet\nlabs spec helper.  The specific method that provides scope instances in\nPuppet-version-independent way is something like this:\n\n    let(:scope) { PuppetlabsSpec::PuppetSeams.parser_scope }\n\nThis patch simply implements this across the board.",

    "body": "This commit adds a new parameter called \"match\"\nto the file_line resource type, and support for\nthis new parameter to the corresponding ruby\nprovider.\n\nThis parameter is optional; file_line should work\njust as before if you do not specify this parameter...\nso this change should be backwards-compatible.\n\nIf you do specify the parameter, it is treated\nas a regular expression that should be used when\nlooking through the file for a line.  This allows\nyou to do things like find a line that begins with\na certain prefix (e.g., \"foo=.*\"), and *replace*\nthe existing line with the line you specify in your\n\"line\" parameter.  Without this capability, if you\nalready had a line \"foo=bar\" in your file and your\n\"line\" parameter was set to \"foo=baz\", you'd end up\nwith *both* lines in the final file.  In many cases\nthis is undesirable.",

These\nchanges are a problem because we cannot introduce backwards incompatible\nchanges in a minor release.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by back porting the implementation of the\n`Puppet::Util.absolute_path?` from 2.7.x to the function block itself.\n\nThe function block tests to see if `Puppet::Util.absolute_path?` will\nrespond and if not, falls back to the inline back ported implementation.\n\nThe spec tests have been updated to simulate the behavior of Puppet 2.6\neven when running with Puppet 2.7.",

I'm to blame for it.\nUsers stumble over this quite often and they shouldn't have to go read\nthe code to sort out what's happening.\n\nThis patch makes an effort to fix the problem by adding a third,\noptional, argument to validate_re().  This third argument will be the\nmessage thrown back in the exception which will be displayed to the end\nuser.\n\nThis sets the stage for nicer error messages coming from modules we\nwrite.\n\nThis patch is backwards compatible but is a new feature.",

This patch\nfixes the problem by only calling methods on the object returned by the\n`getent passwd root` command if the object evaluates to true.\n\nBecause there is no root account on Windows the code block simply\nreturns `nil` which makes the Facter fact undefined on Windows\nplatforms.\n\nThe root cause of the failure is that we always expected the command to\nsucceed and return something useful, and it may not on all supported\nplatforms.",

    "body": "On Windows, we have no folders that match up to the default set of\ndirectories the facter_dot_d fact looks in by default.  This is a\nproblem because the Puppet Enterprise installer writes out the following\nfacts by default, and our modules require them to be present:\n\n    % cat /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt\n    fact_stomp_port=61613\n    fact_stomp_server=puppetmaster\n    fact_is_puppetagent=true\n    fact_is_puppetmaster=true\n    fact_is_puppetconsole=true\n\nOn windows, the Puppet confdir is quite variable.  On 2003 systems we\ndefault to the All Users application data directory.  On 2008 systems we\ndefault to the ProgramData directory.  The actual configuration\ndirectory varies depending on the Puppet or Puppet Enterprise branding.\n\nIn order to simplify all of this variable behavior, this patch fixes the\nproblem by automatically looking for facts in Puppet[:confdir]/facts.d\nThere is no change in behavior if Puppet is not actually loaded into\nmemory.\n\nThis patch paves the way for the MSI installer to use an IniFile element\nto write custom facts during installation.  Since we're already writing\ncustom data into the puppet.conf file, and the 'facts.d' directory will\nbe a sub-folder of the folder containing puppet.conf, we'll be\nreasonably guaranteed this implementation will be robust for all Windows\nplatforms that Puppet itself runs on.\n(#12357) Add puppet_vardir custom fact\n\nWithout this patch the PE modules don't have a way to identify a\nfilesystem path where it's OK to place variable data related to managing\nthe target node.  This is a problem when a module like pe_compliance\nneeds to write a wrapper script to the node's filesystem.\n\nThis patch addresses the problem by exposing the node's Puppet[:vardir]\nsetting as a Facter fact.\n\nThis fact value will be set to `nil` if Puppet is not loaded into\nmemory.  If Puppet is loaded, e.g. using `facter --puppet` or using\n`puppet agent` or `puppet apply` then the fact will automatically set\nthe value to Puppet[:vardir]\n\nThe value of this setting is subject to Puppet's run_mode.\n\nThis patch implements a new utility method in the standard library\nmodule named `Facter::Util::PuppetSettings.with_puppet`.  The method\naccepts a block and will only invoke the block if the Puppet library is\nloaded into the Ruby process.  If Puppet is not loaded, the method\nalways returns nil.  This makes it easy to define Facter facts that only\ngive values if Puppet is loaded in memory.",

    "body": "On Windows, we have no folders that match up to the default set of\ndirectories the facter_dot_d fact looks in by default.  This is a\nproblem because the Puppet Enterprise installer writes out the following\nfacts by default, and our modules require them to be present:\n\n    % cat /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt\n    fact_stomp_port=61613\n    fact_stomp_server=puppetmaster\n    fact_is_puppetagent=true\n    fact_is_puppetmaster=true\n    fact_is_puppetconsole=true\n\nOn windows, the Puppet confdir is quite variable.  On 2003 systems we\ndefault to the All Users application data directory.  On 2008 systems we\ndefault to the ProgramData directory.  The actual configuration\ndirectory varies depending on the Puppet or Puppet Enterprise branding.\n\nIn order to simplify all of this variable behavior, this patch fixes the\nproblem by automatically looking for facts in Puppet[:confdir]/facts.d\nThere is no change in behavior if Puppet is not actually loaded into\nmemory.\n\nThis patch paves the way for the MSI installer to use an IniFile element\nto write custom facts during installation.  Since we're already writing\ncustom data into the puppet.conf file, and the 'facts.d' directory will\nbe a sub-folder of the folder containing puppet.conf, we'll be\nreasonably guaranteed this implementation will be robust for all Windows\nplatforms that Puppet itself runs on.\n(#12357) Add puppet_vardir custom fact\n\nWithout this patch the PE modules don't have a way to identify a\nfilesystem path where it's OK to place variable data related to managing\nthe target node.  This is a problem when a module like pe_compliance\nneeds to write a wrapper script to the node's filesystem.\n\nThis patch addresses the problem by exposing the node's Puppet[:vardir]\nsetting as a Facter fact.\n\nThis fact value will be set to `nil` if Puppet is not loaded into\nmemory.  If Puppet is loaded, e.g. using `facter --puppet` or using\n`puppet agent` or `puppet apply` then the fact will automatically set\nthe value to Puppet[:vardir]\n\nThe value of this setting is subject to Puppet's run_mode.\n\nThis patch implements a new utility method in the standard library\nmodule named `Facter::Util::PuppetSettings.with_puppet`.  The method\naccepts a block and will only invoke the block if the Puppet library is\nloaded into the Ruby process.  If Puppet is not loaded, the method\nalways returns nil.  This makes it easy to define Facter facts that only\ngive values if Puppet is loaded in memory.",

This patch\nfixes the problem by only calling methods on the object returned by the\n`getent passwd root` command if the object evaluates to true.\n\nBecause there is no root account on Windows the code block simply\nreturns `nil` which makes the Facter fact undefined on Windows\nplatforms.\n\nThe root cause of the failure is that we always expected the command to\nsucceed and return something useful, and it may not on all supported\nplatforms.\n\nCloses: GH-39",

    "body": "In future versions of OS X, PBKDF2 passwords are utilized. This password\r\nhashing scheme requires a plaintext password, a salt, and a value for\r\nthe number of iterations to programmatically execute the hashing scheme\r\nbefore it will generate a password hash. The resultant password hash\r\nevaluates to be a 256 character hex value, and is tied to the value of\r\nthe salt (a string) and the iterations (an integer). If the salt or the\r\niterations value is changed, the resultant password hash will be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nBecause these values are so intimately related, Puppet will need to\r\nsupport two additional properties for the User resource type ('salt' and\r\n'iterations'). This function will assist Puppet users who manage\r\nUser resources in versions of OS X that support PBKDF2 passwords.\r\n\r\nPassing a value for the plaintext password, the salt, and the\r\niterations, the function will return a 256-character password hash that\r\ncan be directly inserted into a User resource's password property.\r\n\r\nSpec tests are also included to ensure that correct values are passed\r\nand calculated.",

    "body": "On Windows, we have no folders that match up to the default set of\ndirectories the facter_dot_d fact looks in by default.  This is a\nproblem because the Puppet Enterprise installer writes out the following\nfacts by default, and our modules require them to be present:\n\n    % cat /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt\n    fact_stomp_port=61613\n    fact_stomp_server=puppetmaster\n    fact_is_puppetagent=true\n    fact_is_puppetmaster=true\n    fact_is_puppetconsole=true\n\nOn windows, the Puppet confdir is quite variable.  On 2003 systems we\ndefault to the All Users application data directory.  On 2008 systems we\ndefault to the ProgramData directory.  The actual configuration\ndirectory varies depending on the Puppet or Puppet Enterprise branding.\n\nIn order to simplify all of this variable behavior, this patch fixes the\nproblem by automatically looking for facts in Puppet[:confdir]/facts.d\nThere is no change in behavior if Puppet is not actually loaded into\nmemory.\n\nThis patch paves the way for the MSI installer to use an IniFile element\nto write custom facts during installation.  Since we're already writing\ncustom data into the puppet.conf file, and the 'facts.d' directory will\nbe a sub-folder of the folder containing puppet.conf, we'll be\nreasonably guaranteed this implementation will be robust for all Windows\nplatforms that Puppet itself runs on.\n\n(#12357) Add node_vardir custom fact\n====================================\n\nWithout this patch the PE modules don't have a way to identify a\nfilesystem path where it's OK to place variable data related to managing\nthe target node.  This is a problem when a module like pe_compliance\nneeds to write a wrapper script to the node's filesystem.\n\nThis patch addresses the problem by exposing the node's Puppet[:vardir]\nsetting as a Facter fact.\n\nThis fact value will be set to `nil` if Puppet is not loaded into\nmemory.  If Puppet is loaded, e.g. using `facter --puppet` or using\n`puppet agent` or `puppet apply` then the fact will automatically set\nthe value to Puppet[:vardir]\n\nThe value of this setting is subject to Puppet's run_mode.\n\nThis patch implements a new utility method in the standard library\nmodule named `Facter::Util::PuppetSettings.with_puppet`.  The method\naccepts a block and will only invoke the block if the Puppet library is\nloaded into the Ruby process.  If Puppet is not loaded, the method\nalways returns nil.  This makes it easy to define Facter facts that only\ngive values if Puppet is loaded in memory.",

    "body": "This pull request SHOULD NOT BE MERGED YET.  This is going to be a fairly long\nrunning work in progress while I sort out the modules distributed with Puppet\nEnterprise.  I'm submitting this pull request early in the process in an effort\nto get early feedback on the implementation decisions.\n\nPlease comment.\n\n(#12357) Make facter_dot_d look in Puppet[:confdir]/facts.d\n\nOn Windows, we have no folders that match up to the default set of\ndirectories the facter_dot_d fact looks in by default.  This is a\nproblem because the Puppet Enterprise installer writes out the following\nfacts by default, and our modules require them to be present:\n\n    % cat /etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt\n    fact_stomp_port=61613\n    fact_stomp_server=puppetmaster\n    fact_is_puppetagent=true\n    fact_is_puppetmaster=true\n    fact_is_puppetconsole=true\n\nOn windows, the Puppet confdir is quite variable.  On 2003 systems we\ndefault to the All Users application data directory.  On 2008 systems we\ndefault to the ProgramData directory.  The actual configuration\ndirectory varies depending on the Puppet or Puppet Enterprise branding.\n\nIn order to simplify all of this variable behavior, this patch fixes the\nproblem by automatically looking for facts in Puppet[:confdir]/facts.d\nThere is no change in behavior if Puppet is not actually loaded into\nmemory.\n\nThis patch paves the way for the MSI installer to use an IniFile element\nto write custom facts during installation.  Since we're already writing\ncustom data into the puppet.conf file, and the 'facts.d' directory will\nbe a sub-folder of the folder containing puppet.conf, we'll be\nreasonably guaranteed this implementation will be robust for all Windows\nplatforms that Puppet itself runs on.\n(#12357) Fix root_home fact on Windows\n\nWithout this patch the root_home fact fails on windows.  This patch\nfixes the problem by implementing a code block confined to windows for\nthe fact's value resolution.\n\nThe implementation is as follows, looking entirely to the environment:\n\n * Use %ProgramData% if it is set, otherwise...\n * Use %LOCALAPPDATA% if it is set, otherwise...\n * Use %TEMP% if it is set, otherwise...\n * nil\n\nThere is no concept of a \"home directory for the root user\" on windows,\nso we're defaulting to the closest thing we have available, the\n%ProgramData% folder on modern windows operating systems.",

In the use case of class ntp { } declaring\r\n    ntp::{package,config,service} classes, the ntp class itself should allow\r\n    the user to specify before and require relationships to the main ntp\r\n    class.\r\n    \r\n    The anchor resource type allows module authors to close the loop on\r\n    classes composing the main top level module.  For example:\r\n    \r\n        class ntp {\r\n          class { 'ntp::package': }\r\n          -> class { 'ntp::config': }\r\n          -> class { 'ntp::service': }\r\n          # These two resources \"anchor\" the composed classes\r\n          # such that the end user may use \"require\" and \"before\"\r\n          # relationships with Class['ntp']\r\n          anchor { 'ntp::begin': } -> class { 'ntp::package': }\r\n          class { 'ntp::service': } -> anchor { 'ntp::end': }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    Using this pattern, the module user may then simply declare relationships to\r\n    the ntp class as they expect:\r\n    \r\n        class { 'ntp': } -> class { 'mcollective': }\r\n        # OR\r\n        class { 'mcollective': } -> class { 'ntp': }",
