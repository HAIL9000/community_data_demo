As an\r\nexample, Puppet Enterprise catalogs fail to compile if the\r\n`fact_stomp_server`, and `fact_stomp_port` facts are not defined.\r\n\r\n`facter_dot_d` was removed from stdlib version 4 because Facter version\r\n1.7 now supports external facts defined in\r\n`/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt`.\r\nPuppet Enterprise does not yet include Facter 1.7, however.  The most\r\nrecent PE release, 2.8.1, includes Facter 1.6.17.  With this version of\r\nFacter, users who replace the version of stdlib that ships with PE with\r\nthe most recent version from the Forge will lose the ability to resolve\r\nfacts from\r\n`/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/puppet_enterprise_installer.txt`.\r\n\r\nThis patch addresses the problem by detecting if Facter version < 1.7 is\r\nloaded.  If so, then the facter_dot_d.rb facts will be defined using the\r\nstdlib custom fact.  If Facter >= 1.7 is being used then stdlib will not\r\ndefine external facts.",
